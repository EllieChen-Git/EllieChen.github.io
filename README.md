## <u>Overview of Portfolio Website</u>

### Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my ability in coding and web development. It can also be used as an excellent medium for the target audience to know more about me personally (my hobbies and personalities) and professionally (my previous work experiences, skills and personal projects).

In addition to that, the portfolio serves as a good example to demonstrate my planning and desgining process of a website, and it is a great opportunity for me to transform what I have learned about HTML, CSS and SASS in class into a final product. If anyone is interested in knowing more, they have the access to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium, Resume and Emial through the website.
